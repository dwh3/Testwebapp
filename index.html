            <p>Welcome to my webpage, and thank you for stopping by! I'm David Hummel, currently deepening my knowledge in the Economics Ph.D. program at Northeastern 
                University. Over the past five years, alongside my academic journey, I've embraced various roles in external firms. My lifelong fascination with mathematics 
                and logical reasoning has evolved into a profound appreciation for computer science. I'm driven by a desire to harness my skills and make a tangible impact. 
                As you explore further, you'll discover highlights of my professional and academic milestones, my foundational skillset, and the passions I'm currently pursuing.

            My passion for mathematics and problem solving led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Systems and Engineering at The Ohio State Univeristy.
             This provided me with a robust understanding of engineering principles, systems optimization, and the interdisciplinary nature
              of engineering and its applications in various industries.
            While a senior at Ohio State, I took an Operations Research course which sparked my interest in the optimization practices.

            In my main project at Lockheed Martin, I combined Business Intelligence tools, VBA, and batch scripting to generate reports by product area.
            I automated these reports to be sent daily to the inboxes of area managers and displayed them on television screens throughout the facility.
            This automation enabled managers to spend less time on report generation while giving them a clear snapshot of the manufacturers' performance. <br><br>


            In my second project, I collaborated with the senior in-house Oracle developer. Together, we addressed a challenge in the building process where numerous
             small parts had to be retrieved from a warehouse and assembled into a kit. We designed an application that expedited the collection of these parts and 
             facilitated the tracking of each piece of equipment throughout the assembly process. This system also accounted for out-of-stock parts, allowing the assembly to commence without them. <br><br>
   
             I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Lockheed Martin but felt a pull toward acquiring a more versatile toolkit. Drawing from my background in Operations Research and my growing passion for computer science,
              I chose to delve into Economics, which I saw as the ideal fusion of these fields. <br><br>

            <p>
                Balancing my roles, I often work as a research assistant alongside my duties as a teaching assistant. This dual responsibility has introduced me to myriad projects,
                 each contributing to my growing and diverse skillset. In one such project, I was the bridge between my manager, Professor Bilge Erten, and a trio of undergraduate students. 
                 Navigating this inter-generational dynamic, I emphasized transparent communication, set clear expectations, and nurtured a cooperative and efficient work environment.
                 The following are the more notable projects I have worked on the Professor Erten.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    One ongoing research delves into the impact of the inauguration of Public Juvenile Mental Health facilities (CAPS) in Brazil on educational outcomes. Our team is harnessing
                     healthcare data from Brazil's Ministry of Health and educational data from its Ministry of Education. This massive dataset encompasses over 3 million children. We match these
                      children with control units using precise matching techniques and employ an event study framework to assess the influence of these facilities. While the specific data on education
                       and treatment is confidential, a segment of this project required pinpointing the geolocations of the facilities. I achieved this using the Google Maps API, and you can view
                        a demonstration of my approach <a href="https://dwh3.github.io/Testwebapp/DisplayProgramming.html?lecture=GoogleMapsAPI">here</a>.

                    Another paper under peer review investigates the repercussions of OxyContin's reformulation on Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) rates. Our analysis demanded a comprehensive record 
                    of reported IPV incidents. I crafted and executed scripts to gather, refine, and integrate controls into three decades of data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report.
                </li>

                My dissertation comprises three distinct chapters, each reflecting a unique area of research:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The inaugural chapter originated from a project during my RA tenure. It delves into the price dynamics observed when a nascent, disruptive firm expands to mirror the stature of an 
                    established incumbent. I crafted a dynamic model to simulate a firm's pricing strategy as it evolves. This model anticipates an initial phase where the firm disrupts the market with
                     declining prices, followed by a surge in prices as the firm matures. Empirically, this trajectory was evident in the case study of Southwest Airlines.

                    Building on my RA research on Intimate Partner Violence, the second chapter assesses the impact of substance use treatment facilities on such violence. While I utilized the same 
                    crime dataset, I also extracted data on treatment facilities from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) website. I'll be sharing the code for this
                     data extraction shortly.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    The final chapter, inspired by my tenure at the American Antitrust Institute, focuses on the US beef market. I'm investigating the tactics employed by beef processors, specifically 
                    how they leverage contractual procurement to depress cattle prices. My analysis seeks to determine if the trajectory of this price reduction aligns with competitive market behaviors.

            During my second summer in the Ph.D. program, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team of political scientists and public health experts. 
            Our focus was on exploring the connection between political polarization and health outcomes. While the team had already gathered survey data, 
            I took on the responsibility of conducting a literature review. This review helped establish a solid foundation for our modeling framework. 
            I then implemented the model, and our collective efforts culminated in the publication of the two papers listed above.

            In addition to my primary pursuits, I've embarked on a journey of continuous 
            learning both out of personal interest and to further hone my technical skills.
             I've been self-learning C++, sharpening my SQL skills,  and diving deep into general computer
              science concepts through LeetCode problems. My progress can be seen on my LeetCode profile
              , which is available <a href="https://leetcode.com/dwh3/" target="_blank">here</a>. 
              Furthermore, I'm actively enhancing my understanding of Machine Learning by taking courses on Coursera.
