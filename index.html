            <p>Raised in the scenic town of Moundsville, West Virginia, I developed a deep-seated passion for mathematics from a young age.
                 This passion led me to Ohio State University, where he pursued an undergraduate degree in engineering. 
                 While a senior at Ohio State, I took an Operations Research course which sparked my interest in the generalizable tools OR and Economics offer.

        After graduation, I embarked on a professional journey at Lockheed Martin, gaining invaluable experience in the field. During my time at Lockheed Martin,
         I developed internal applications to be used on the manufacturing floor. <br><br>

         Automated displays - Conceptualized and implemented an automated network to update facility screens presentations using VBA, batch scripting,
         and advanced business intelligence tools, improving communication and operational effectiveness across the facility.<br><br>

         Kitting Process - Collaborated with a senior in-house Oracle developer to design and develop an application that enhanced the kitting process.
         This solution significantly improved accuracy, timeliness, and provided informative insights, ensuring a more efficient workflow
         and increased productivity.

        From the Spring of my first year of my Ph.D. to the Fall of the second year, I worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 
        2019 Federal Reserve Mobile Financial Services Survey - Automated distribution, cleaned and analyzed the results, and helped edit the survey results for report.
        <br><br>
        Payment Identity & Authentication Fraud - Developed a model of fraud types and leveraged industry white papers to understand associated mitigation strategies.

        From the Spring of my third year of my Ph.D. to the Spring of the fourth year, I worked as a Research Fellow at the American Antitrust Institute.
        During this time, we created three industy white papers. <br><br>

                The first was <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4012999" target="_blank">"Anticipating the Next Generation of Powerful Digital Players: Implications for Competition Policy"</a>.
                Collaborated in formulating research questions, conducted data collection and statistical analysis, and contributed to drafting
                the final document....NEED TO MENTION SOMETHING ABOUT PROPENSITY SCORE MATHCING HERE <br><br>

                Comment to D OJ on Time Warner and Discovery, rebutted claims of efficiency gains from past mergers and economic arguments made in prior filings<br><br>

                Comment to DOT on American Airlines and JetBlue, rReviewed code-sharing literature and extended it to the case of these parties.

            In the Spring of 2022, I taught Master's level Econometrics at Northeastern University. The lectures for my course material 
            <a href="https://dwh3.github.io/Testwebapp/DisplayLectures.html">can be found here</a>.

            <br><br>

            During the Economics Ph.D. program at Northeastern University, at the beginning of your second year, each student must take a week long Math Boot Camp. I have taught this every year I have been 
            in the program after my second year. This involves teaching Linear Algebra (<a href="https://dwh3.github.io/Testwebapp/EconometricsLectures/LinearAlgebraLectures.pdf" target="_blank">the material covered can be viewed/downloaded here</a>), 

            and Static Optimization (<a href="https://dwh3.github.io/Testwebapp/EconometricsLectures/StaticOptimization.pdf" target="_blank">the material covered can be viewed/downloaded here</a>).

            <br><br>
           
             and TA duties (at Northeastern and Harvard),

             <br><br>
              as well as teaching at Bentley University.

            <p> As part of my RA work, I needed to retrieve the geolocations of juvenile mental health facilities in Brazil.
                I have my coding demonstrations for how I did this using Google Maps API <a href="https://dwh3.github.io/Testwebapp/DisplayProgramming.html?lecture=GoogleMapsAPI"> here</a> 
                Accessed and manipulated disparate healthcare data from the Brazil Ministry of Health on a remote server, joined it with
                schooling datasets, and conducted an evaluation on the impact of mental health facilities on youth educational outcomes,
                offering new insights into the intersection of health and education policies.</p>

            <p> Developed and implemented scripts to collect, clean, and merge controls into 30 years’ worth of FBI data. 
                Served as a liaison between professors and an undergraduate team of three in an inter-generational setting, effectively
                managing communication and expectations while promoting a collaborative and productive environment.</p>
        
            <p> For my dissertation, I am evaluating the effect of Substance use treatment facilities on Intimate Partner Violence.
                I have my coding demonstrations <a href="https://dwh3.github.io/Testwebapp/DisplayProgramming.html?lecture=TreatmentUseCenterAnalysis"> here</a> </p>

            <p> Initially as part of my RA work, which subsequently became a part of my disseration, I developed theoretical framework of ”Endogenous Maverick Behavior: A Model with Application and Evidence”</p>
