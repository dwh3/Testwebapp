            <p>Raised in the scenic town of Moundsville, West Virginia, I developed a deep-seated passion for mathematics from a young age.
                 This passion led me to Ohio State University, where he pursued an undergraduate degree in engineering. 
                 While a senior at Ohio State, I took an Operations Research course which sparked my interest in the generalizable tools OR and Economics offer.

        <p>
        After graduation, I embarked on a professional journey at Lockheed Martin, gaining invaluable experience in the field. During my time at Lockheed Martin,
         I developed internal applications to be used on the manufacturing floor. The first generated process times across the site, automated the reporting of this
          to area managers, and displayed the results on a screen in the assembly area. The second used HTML, and SQL to make the kitting process more efficient, while
           allowing for the tracking of parts and orders throughout the warehouse.

        From the Spring of my third year of my Ph.D. to the Spring of the fourth year, I worked as a Research Fellow at the American Antitrust Institute.
        During this time, we created three industy white papers. <br><br>

                The first was <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4012999" target="_blank">"Anticipating the Next Generation of Powerful Digital Players: Implications for Competition Policy"</a>. <br><br>

            Want to mention Math Camp, graduate econometrics, and TA duties (at Northeastern and Harvard), as well as teaching at Bentley University.
            In the Spring of 2022, I taught Master's level Econometrics at Northeastern University. The lectures for my course material 
            <a href="https://dwh3.github.io/Testwebapp/DisplayLectures.html">can be found here</a>.

            <p> As part of my RA work, I needed to retrieve the geolocations of juvenile mental health facilities in Brazil.
                I have my coding demonstrations for how I did this using Google Maps API <a href="https://dwh3.github.io/Testwebapp/DisplayProgramming.html?lecture=GoogleMapsAPI"> here</a> </p>
        
            <p> For my dissertation, I am evaluating the effect of Substance use treatment facilities on Intimate Partner Violence.

            <p>Words describing what I did during my time working with the Political Science group. During this time, we created two papers which were subsequently published. <br><br>

                The first was <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/1/1/pgac011/6545770" target="_blank">"The harmful effects of partisan polarization on health", published in PNAS NEXUS</a>. <br><br>

                The second was <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10659129211034561" target="_blank">"Bridging the Divide: Does Social Capital Moderate the Impact of Polarization on Health?", published in Political Research Quarterly</a>. <br><br>
                was something else.
